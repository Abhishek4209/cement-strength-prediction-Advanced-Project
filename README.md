# Machine Learning Project

## Cement Strength Prediction
The Cement Strength Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the strength of cement based on various factors such as the composition of ingredients, curing time, and environmental conditions. By analyzing these factors, the project aims to provide insights into the performance of cement and support decision-making processes in the construction industry.
